# Simple Website Using Github Pages
Make a simple HTML website and publish it using Github Pages.  
View example: https://cplmakerlab.github.io/simple-website-template/

## Setup
- Create a Github account (if you don't have one yet)
- Fork this repository to copy it to your account, i.e. github.com/username/simple-website-template (you can rename it as well)
- Make sure you see the gh-pages branch (it should be the default)
- Edit website files on the gh-pages branch, then wait a minute or two for Github Pages to update and deploy your site.
- View your site: https://username.github.io/simple-website-template

## How does this work?
This website template uses CSS & JS to hide and show different parts of index.html and uses Github Pages to render the website from the gh-pages branch.

## Things to try
- Edit index.html and change the title of the page (both ```<title>``` in the header and ```<h1>``` in the body)
- Upload your own logo.jpg and background.jpg images to overwrite the default images.
- Edit index.html and change the content displayed in home, about, and contact.
- Edit index.html and change the content in the footer region.
- Edit style.css and change the link color and font style.
- Update the metadata in the header portion of index.html (this is used by search engines and browsers).

## Common tags

Element | Tag | Example usage
--- | --- | ---
Header | h1 | ```<h1>Title of page</h1>```
Link | a | ```<a href="http://example.com">Check out this link</a>```
Image | img | ```<img src="http://www.example.com/image.jpg">```
Paragraph | p | ```<p>This is a new paragraph.</p>```
Line break | br | ```This is the first line of a poem. <br> This second line will appear below the first. ```

### Can I configure a custom domain for my site, i.e. johnnymakerportfolio.com?
Yes! Github Pages supports [custom domain configuration](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site). However, you will need to buy a domain name from a registrar such as [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) or [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/) -- the cost is usually around $10 - $15 a year.
